# Advanced AI Gym Application

## Overview

The Advanced AI Gym Application is a reinforcement learning project that trains an AI agent to balance a pole on a cart using the OpenAI Gym framework. The project utilizes a neural network to approximate Q-values for actions based on the state of the environment, aiming to maximize the total reward collected by the agent over a series of episodes.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implements a simple Q-learning algorithm using a neural network.
- **OpenAI Gym**: Utilizes the CartPole environment from the OpenAI Gym library.
- **Model Training**: The agent learns through trial and error by interacting with the environment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Required Libraries

To set up the project, install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install gym numpy tensorflow
