The Advanced AI Gym Application is a reinforcement learning project that trains an AI agent to balance a pole on a cart using the OpenAI Gym framework. The project utilizes a neural network to approximate Q-values for actions based on the state of the environment, aiming to maximize the total reward collected by the agent over a series of episodes.
